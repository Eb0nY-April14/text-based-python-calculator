# Text-based Calculator

This is a calculator project that was created using Python Programming language. It is a very basic calculator with simple functionalities which allows a user to input a number or 2 numbers based on the operation to be performed and the code carries out the operation and returns the appropriate result. Interaction with the calculator is restricted to the terminal as Python is a back-end language so there is no GUI available to the user. They simply follow the text-based instructions displayed at the terminal aand if the instructions are followed correctly, they will get their desired result printed to the terminal.

# Features

The calculator provides the basic function of a simple calculator which can be used by any one for their everyday mathematical operations.

# Existing Features

The features provided by the calculator are as follows:

* choice 'a' for Add ('+') operator to add two numbers 
* choice 'b' for Subtract ('-') operator to subtract two numbers
* choice 'c' for Multiply ('*') operator to multiply two numbers 
* choice 'd' for Divide ('/') operator to divide two numbers
* choice 'e' for Modulo ('%') operator to get the remainder of two  numbers after division
* choice 'f' for Power/Exponent ('**') operator to get the exponent of two numbers 
* choice 'g' for Square Root ('âˆš') operator to get the square root of a number.
